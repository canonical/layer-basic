      These should be in standard Python requirement form.  This is useful
      if you have Python libraries that your charm code depends on but which
      require compilation on the target architecture, and thus can't be
      pre-packaged in the wheelhouse.

      Install charm dependencies (wheelhouse) into a Python virtual environment

    description: >
      If using a virtual environment, allow the venv to see Python packages
      installed at the system level.  This reduces isolation, but is necessary
      to use Python packages installed via apt-get.
